This is the first one! <br /> <br /> Ghost is made by an independent non-profit organisation called the Ghost Foundation. We are 100% self funded by revenue from our Ghost(Pro) service, and every penny we make is re-invested into funding further development of free, open source technology for modern publishing.",

    "textTwo": "The version of Ghost you are looking at right now would not have been made possible without generous contributions from the open source community. <br /> <br /> By the way, once you’re done reading, you can simply delete the default Ghost user from your team to remove all of these introductory posts!"
